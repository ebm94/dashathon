# Dashaton: a marathon training tool for runners

## Background
The participation rate in marathons is increasing year by year, rendering a huge market of runners preparing for them. The worldwide growth from 2008 to 2018 was +49.43%. Women are picking up faster than men with a growth of +56.83% while menâ€™s participation rate has increased +46.91%. The Abbott World Marathon Majors is a championship-style competition for marathon runners that started in 2006. A points based competition founded on six major city marathon races, the series currently comprises annual races for the cities of Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York City, with about a million dollars worth in prize money associated with it. This project is a dashboard intended to help runners train better for upcoming marathons, especially the ones in the Abbott World Marathon Majors.
